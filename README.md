Twitter-Nuker
=============

Nukes your Twitter account (except for items in the keep list)

Add your Twitter information to the config.json file, along with any strings of IDs of statuses you want to keep, then set the account name.

Upon running it, it should pull your last 3,200 statuses and delete them, 20 at a time. You should be able to run it multiple times to delete the rest, but I haven't actually tested that.
